Welcome! 

I am a scientific software developer working for [OLI Systems, Inc](https://www.olisystems.com). In this role, I refactored the legacy FORTRAN codebase in modern C++, developed the backend of Cloud APIs, tested software products prior to a release. I started this job after graudating from the [University of Houston](https://www.chee.uh.edu) with Ph.D. degree in chemical engineering. 

At the University of Houston, I was engaged in foundamental research of tetrahedral liquids at supercooled condition through computer simulations. This research field is multidisciplinary in nature, interweaving computer science with statistical mechanics and physical chemistry to tackle the myth of water's anomalies, an unresolved scientific puzzle. 

Prior to my Ph.D., I obtained Bacholer of Science in chemical engineering from the [University of Wisconsin Madison](https://engineering.wisc.edu/departments/chemical-biological-engineering/). My undergradaute studies and research projects spurred my interests in coding, and numerical modeling. 

This website documents my learning experience of C++, machine learning algorithms, and open-source software projects. I benefit immensely from the open-source community where people unconditionally share their knowledge and expertise. Now, it is my turn to give back.
