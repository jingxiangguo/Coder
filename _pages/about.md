Welcome! 

I am a scientific software developer working for [OLI Systems, Inc](https://www.olisystems.com). In this role, I refactored legacy FORTRAN libraries in modern C++, developed the backend of Cloud APIs, maintain and test our software products. I started this job after graudating with Ph.D. degree in chemical engineering from the [University of Houston](https://www.chee.uh.edu). At the University of Houston, I was engaged in foundamental research of tetrahedral liquids through computer simulations. This research field is multidisciplinary in nature, interweaving computer science with statistical mechanics and physical chemistry to tackle one horny scientific challenge. Prior to my Ph.D., I obtained Bacholer of Science in chemical engineering from the [University of Wisconsin Madison](https://engineering.wisc.edu/departments/chemical-biological-engineering/). My undergradaute studies and research projects spurred my early interests in coding, and numerical modeling, which led me to my Ph.D. research and current job.  

This website serves as my personal notebook documenting my learning experience of C++, machine learning algorithms, and open-source software projects. I benefit immensely from the open-source community where people unconditionally share their knowledge and expertise. Now, it is my turn to give back.
