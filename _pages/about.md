I have been trained as a chemical engineer. During my Ph.D., I witnessed how the scientific research of supercooled liquid can be transformed by novel simulation techniques, machine learning algorithms and, most importantly, the advent of increasingly powerful supercomputers. Having realized the tremendous potential of computational approach in industrial and academic endeavors, I committed to becoming a computational scientist with addtional scientific software skills complementary to my previous STEM training. With rapid growth of machine learning algorithms and high-performance computing hardware, I believe the digitalization and automation of domain knowledge and expertise will be an inevitable movement.
