Welcome! 
I am a scientific software developer working for [OLI Systems, Inc](https://www.olisystems.com). I started this job after graudating with Ph.D. degree in chemical engineering from the [University of Houston](https://www.chee.uh.edu). At the University of Houston, I was engaged in foundamental science research of tetrahedral liquids through computer simulations. This research field interweaves computer science, statistical mechanics, and physical chemistry.  Prior to my Ph.D., I obtained Bacholer of Science in chemical engineering from the [University of Wisconsin Madison](https://engineering.wisc.edu/departments/chemical-biological-engineering/). My undergradaute studies and research projects spurred my early interests in coding, and numerical modeling. 

This website serves as my personal notebook documenting my learning experience of C++, machine learning algorithms, and open-source software projects. I benefit immensely from the open-source community where people unconditionally share their knowledge and expertise. Now, it is my turn to give back.
